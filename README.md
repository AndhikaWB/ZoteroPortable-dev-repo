# ZoteroPortable
Zotero in PortableApps.com Format

With Mozilla switching to webextensions, Zotero had to adapt. The developpers dropped support of the legacy extension for firefox, and focused their efforts on Zotero Standalone.
Unfortunately, the version created by <a href="https://portableapps.com/node/36565">orschiro</a> is out of date, as it's based on version 4, and not fully portable if you update it to 5, as it creates Zotero's profile and store user data in %APPDATA%\Zotero.

With my version, version 5 of Zotero is portable.
This version of Zotero is not officially endorsed by Zotero Team. <a href="https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/64050/5-0-portable-zotero">Do not expect official support for portable version issues.</a></p>
